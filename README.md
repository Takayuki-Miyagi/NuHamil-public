This code is to generate the nucleon-nucleon (NN) and three-nucleon (3N) matrix elements.
The generated NN and 3N files can be used as inputs of the many-body solvers such as imsrg++ code (https://github.com/ragnarstroberg/imsrg) and HartreeFock code (https://github.com/Takayuki-Miyagi/HartreeFock).
It is also possible to compute the few body system with the Jacobi coordinate no-core shell model.

# Requirements
* Fortran compiler
* BLAS, LAPACK libraries
* GNU Scientific library
* HDF5 library
* zlib

# Installation
Download the code:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Takayuki-Miyagi/NuHamil-public.git
```
(Going to your home directory is not mandatory, but recommended.)

Change the directory and download the submodules:
```
cd NuHamil
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
The executable file can be built via make command.
By default, it will be compiled with gfortran without MPI.
If you want to use the intel compiler and/or turn on the MPI parallelization, please edit the Makefile by yourself.
```
make -j
make install
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin' >> $HOME/.bashrc
source $HOME/.bashrc
```
By default, the symbolic link is created in the HOME/bin directory.
If you want to change it, please change the "INSTLDIR" in the Makefile.

# Some examples
Running a job is managed by a simple python script.
Some example scripts are prepared.
Note that you need to change "path_to_nninput" in the python scripts if you did not download the code in your home directory.
* deuteron properties

This should be finished with in a few seconds.
```
cd $HOME/exe/few-body
python3 deuteron.py
```

* triton properties

As the $N_{\rm max}$ truncation is sufficiently large $N_{\rm max}=40$, this will take a while. (~ half hour with 16 OpenMP threads on MacBook Pro, 2.3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9)
```
cd $HOME/exe/few-body
python3 triton_helium3.py
```

* lab-frame HO NN matrix elements

As the $e_{\rm max}$ truncation is reasonably large $e_{\rm max}=14$, this will take a while. (~ 15 min. with 16 OpenMP threads on MacBook Pro, 2.3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9)
```
cd $HOME/exe
python3 NuHamil_2BME.py
```


* lab-frame HO 3N matrix elements

This will not work on the local machine because of the computational power.
I recommend submitting the job to a workstation or supercomputer.
You need to edit NuHamil_3BME.py script depending on which job submission system is installed on the machine.
This will take ~ 2 days, using 32 OpenMP threads (without MPI). The job is also memory expensive, and you need ~ 200GB RAM.
```
cd $HOME/exe
python3 NuHamil_3BME.py
```

* Multipole decomposition of 2BCs.
This is a quick test to generate the rank 1 magnetic multipole operator for the vector LO 2BCs.
If you increase $e_{\rm max}$, it will take a while.
See arXiv:2504.08711 for the details.
```
cd $HOME/exe
python3 Multipoles.py
```

# Quick benchmarks
Using the NN+3N interaction generated in the above example and the imsrg++ code (https://github.com/ragnarstroberg/imsrg), the ground-state energies of doubly-magic nuclei are the following.
| Nucleus | Interaction| $\lambda_{\rm SRG} \ ({\rm fm}^{-1})$|$e_{\rm max}$ | $E_{\rm 3max}$| $\hbar\omega \ ({\rm MeV})$|$E_{\rm g.s.} \ ({\rm MeV})$ |

# Remarks
Unfortunately, non-locally regulated 3N interaction cannot be fully suppported.
Feel free to contact me (miyagi@theorie.ikp.physik.tu-darmstadt.de) if you are interested in such interactions.
I can provide the HO 3N matrix element files in the Jacobi coordinate or in the laboratory frame.
